# Production Deployment Notes - August 2025

## Equipment Management System Update

### Overview
This deployment includes comprehensive equipment management system testing and critical database schema fixes. All 9 equipment categories have been validated and are ready for production use.

### Database Changes (CRITICAL)
**Migration Required**: Migration 025 - Fix Equipment ID Nullable for Unified Database

#### What Changed:
- Made `equipment_id` column nullable in `bow_equipment` table
- Allows custom equipment creation without database constraint violations
- Preserves existing data and relationships

#### Migration Details:
```bash
# Migration file: arrow_scraper/migrations/025_fix_equipment_id_nullable_unified.py
# Description: Fix Equipment ID Nullable for Unified Database Architecture
# Dependencies: 024
# Target: Unified arrow_database.db
```

### Production Deployment Steps

1. **Pull Latest Changes:**
   ```bash
   cd /path/to/production/archerytools
   git pull origin main
   ```

2. **Database Migration (AUTOMATIC):**
   ```bash
   # Migration will run automatically on startup with start-unified.sh
   ./start-unified.sh ssl yourdomain.com
   
   # Or manual migration if needed:
   cd arrow_scraper
   python migrations/025_fix_equipment_id_nullable_unified.py databases/arrow_database.db
   ```

3. **Verify Migration Success:**
   ```bash
   # Check database schema
   sqlite3 arrow_scraper/databases/arrow_database.db "PRAGMA table_info(bow_equipment);"
   
   # Look for: equipment_id INTEGER (should be nullable, not NOT NULL)
   ```

4. **Test Equipment Creation:**
   - Navigate to any bow setup → Equipment tab → Add Equipment
   - Test creating equipment in each category:
     - String, Sight, Scope, Stabilizer, Arrow Rest, Plunger, Weight, Peep Sight, Other
   - Verify equipment appears in equipment list with proper specifications

### Equipment Categories Validated ✅

1. **String Equipment**
   - Fields: Material, strand count, serving material, loop type
   - Example: BCY Fibers X99 Recurve String

2. **Sight Equipment**

   - Example: Hoyt Archery Pro Hunter Series

3. **Scope Equipment**
   - Fields: Magnification, objective lens size, reticle type
   - Example: Leupold VX-Freedom 1.5-4x20

4. **Stabilizer Equipment**
   - Fields: Length, weight, material, dampening type
   - Example: Bee Stinger Pro Hunter Maxx 10"

5. **Arrow Rest Equipment**
   - Fields: Rest type, activation type, containment features
   - Example: QAD Ultra-Rest HDX

6. **Plunger Equipment**
   - Fields: Plunger type, tension range, material
   - Example: Shibuya DX Carbon Plunger

7. **Weight Equipment**
   - Fields: Weight (ounces), mounting location, thread size
   - Example: Doinker Fatty Weight 3 oz

8. **Peep Sight Equipment**
   - Fields: Aperture diameter, mounting style, clarifying lens
   - Example: G5 Outdoors Meta Pro Hunter Peep

9. **Other Equipment**
   - Fields: Equipment type, custom specifications
   - Example: Test Manufacturer Test Release Aid

### Rollback Plan (If Needed)

If issues arise with the equipment system:

1. **Database Rollback:**
   ```bash
   cd arrow_scraper
   python migrations/025_fix_equipment_id_nullable_unified.py --rollback databases/arrow_database.db
   ```

2. **Code Rollback:**
   ```bash
   git revert 60a0ec4  # Revert to previous commit
   ```

### Monitoring & Verification

**After Deployment, Verify:**
- [ ] Equipment creation works in all 9 categories
- [ ] No "NOT NULL constraint failed" errors in logs
- [ ] Equipment lists display correctly with specifications
- [ ] Manufacturer suggestion system works
- [ ] Equipment edit/delete functions work properly

**Log Monitoring:**
```bash
# Check for equipment-related errors
docker-compose logs api | grep -i equipment
docker-compose logs api | grep -i "NOT NULL"
```

### Documentation Updates

- Updated `docs/DEVELOPMENT_GUIDE.md` with equipment testing procedures
- Updated `CLAUDE.md` with comprehensive testing results
- Added Migration 025 deployment instructions

### Support Information

**Issue**: Equipment creation failing with database constraint errors
**Solution**: Migration 025 fixes nullable equipment_id constraint

**Issue**: Dropdown selection UX could be improved
**Status**: Known issue, marked for future improvement (non-blocking)

**Contact**: This deployment was validated using comprehensive Playwright testing across all equipment categories.
