# Legacy Startup Scripts Archive

This directory contains legacy startup, deployment, and Docker management scripts that have been superseded by the unified `start-unified.sh` script.

## üö® DEPRECATED - USE `./start-unified.sh` INSTEAD

**All scripts in this directory are DEPRECATED and should not be used in production or development.**

**Use the unified startup script instead:**
```bash
# For development
./start-unified.sh dev start
./start-unified.sh dev stop

# For production testing
./start-unified.sh production start
./start-unified.sh production stop

# For SSL production
./start-unified.sh ssl yourdomain.com

# Get help
./start-unified.sh --help
```

## üîÑ Migration Path

If you were using any of these scripts, here's how to migrate:

### Old Development Workflow:
```bash
# OLD (don't use)
./start-hybrid-dev.sh start
./start-docker-dev.sh start
./start-local-dev.sh start
```

### New Unified Workflow:
```bash
# NEW (recommended)
./start-unified.sh dev start          # Local development
./start-unified.sh                    # Docker development
./start-unified.sh dev stop           # Stop development
```

### Old Production Workflow:
```bash
# OLD (don't use)
./docker-production-setup.sh
./fix-production-unified.sh
```

### New Unified Workflow:
```bash
# NEW (recommended)
./start-unified.sh production start   # Production testing
./start-unified.sh ssl yourdomain.com # Production SSL
./start-unified.sh production stop    # Stop production
```
