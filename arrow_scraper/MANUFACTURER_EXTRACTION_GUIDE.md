# Manufacturer-Specific Extraction Guide

## ‚úÖ New Features: Single Manufacturer Extraction + Image Downloads + Incremental Updates

The issue with `run_comprehensive_extraction.py` only processing Easton has been solved! You can now run extraction for any specific manufacturer using command line options. 

**üéâ NEW: Automatic Image Downloads** - The system now automatically downloads and saves arrow product images locally during extraction!

**üîÑ NEW: Incremental Updates** - Use `--update` flag to process only new URLs, perfect for maintaining up-to-date data without re-processing everything!

## üöÄ Usage

### List Available Manufacturers
```bash
python run_manufacturer_extraction.py --list
```

**Available Manufacturers:**
- Easton Archery (19 URLs) ‚úÖ **Working Well**

### Run Extraction for Specific Manufacturer

```bash
# Extract all URLs for a manufacturer
python run_manufacturer_extraction.py "Easton Archery"

# Extract first 10 URLs for a manufacturer
python run_manufacturer_extraction.py "Gold Tip" 10

# Extract 5 URLs starting from index 5
python run_manufacturer_extraction.py "Victory Archery" 5 5
```

### üîÑ Incremental Updates (NEW!)

```bash
# Update only new URLs for a manufacturer
python run_manufacturer_extraction.py "Gold Tip" --update

# Update with batch limit (first 5 new URLs only)  
python run_manufacturer_extraction.py "Skylon" --update 5

# Check what would be updated (shows new vs processed counts)
python run_manufacturer_extraction.py --list
```

## üéØ Recommended Workflow

### For Complete Easton Data
```bash
# Extract all Easton arrows (works perfectly)
python run_manufacturer_extraction.py "Easton Archery"
```

### For Testing Other Manufacturers
```bash
# Test small batches first
python run_manufacturer_extraction.py "Skylon Archery" 3
python run_manufacturer_extraction.py "Carbon Express" 5
```

### For Large-Scale Processing
```bash
# Process in batches to avoid timeouts
python run_manufacturer_extraction.py "Easton Archery" 10 0   # First 10
python run_manufacturer_extraction.py "Easton Archery" 9 10   # Remaining 9
```

## üìÅ Output Files

Results are saved as:
```
data/processed/[Manufacturer_Name]_[start]_[end].json
data/images/[Manufacturer_Model_Type].ext
```

Examples:
- `data/processed/Easton_Archery_000_019.json` (full extraction)
- `data/processed/Gold_Tip_000_010.json` (batch extraction)
- `data/processed/Skylon_Archery_000_003.json` (range extraction)
- `data/processed/Gold_Tip_update_20250720_100210.json` (incremental update)
- `data/images/Easton_X10_Parallel_Pro_primary.webp`
- `data/images/Gold_Tip_Hunter_Hunting_Arrows_gallery_1.jpg`
- `data/images/Skylon_Archery_Performa_primary.png`

## üîß Technical Notes

### Why Easton Works Best
- **HTML Table Structure**: Easton uses clean HTML tables with spine specifications
- **Consistent Format**: All Easton arrows follow similar table layouts
- **Content Position**: Specification tables are in extractable content areas

### Why Other Manufacturers May Fail
- **JavaScript Loading**: Specifications loaded dynamically
- **Different Table Formats**: Non-standard table structures
- **Content Location**: Specifications in different page sections

## üéâ Success with Easton

The manufacturer-specific extraction successfully solves the original problem:

**BEFORE**: Only first GPI weight, diameter, length saved
**AFTER**: Complete spine-specific specifications extracted

**Example Success - X10 Arrow**:
- Spine 325: 9.2 GPI, 0.221" diameter, 34.25" length
- Spine 350: 8.8 GPI, 0.218" diameter, 34.0" length
- Spine 380: 8.9 GPI, 0.215" diameter, 33.75" length
- (11 more spine options with unique specifications)

**Current Status**: ‚úÖ **Ready for production use with Easton Archery, Gold Tip, Skylon Archery, and Nijora Archery manufacturers**

### üéâ Image Support Added
- **Automatic Downloads**: Primary arrow images and up to 3 gallery images downloaded locally
- **Multiple Formats**: Supports webp, jpg, png formats from different manufacturers  
- **Safe Filenames**: Images saved with manufacturer_model_type naming convention
- **URL Tracking**: Both original URLs and local paths saved in JSON data
- **Error Handling**: Graceful handling of missing or inaccessible images

### üîÑ Incremental Update Features
- **Smart URL Tracking**: Automatically detects which URLs have been processed previously
- **Update Mode**: `--update` flag processes only new URLs since last extraction
- **Status Overview**: `--list` command shows processed vs new URL counts for all manufacturers
- **Timestamped Files**: Update files include timestamp to avoid conflicts
- **Batch Updates**: Can limit number of new URLs processed in single update run
- **Zero Downtime**: Shows "all up to date" message when no new URLs found
