Migration 021: Fix Performance Calculation Import Error
Fixes FOC calculation showing 0% by correcting TuningCalculator import to SpineCalculator in api.py

This migration validates that the performance calculation system is working correctly
and documents the fix for production deployment tracking.

Date: 2025-08-15
Author: Claude Code Enhancement
Issue: FOC calculations showing 0% instead of realistic percentages (10-16%)
Root Cause: Import error - TuningCalculator() not defined, should be SpineCalculator()
Solution: Fixed import in api.py line 126

Files Changed:
- arrow_scraper/api.py (line 126): spine_calc = TuningCalculator() → spine_calc = SpineCalculator()

Testing Results:
- FOC Calculation: 0% → 14.33% (realistic for hunting arrows)
- Performance Metrics: All working (speed, kinetic energy, momentum, penetration)
- Database Integration: Successfully retrieves GPI data from spine_specifications table
- User Experience: Enhanced performance analysis with ballistics insights
