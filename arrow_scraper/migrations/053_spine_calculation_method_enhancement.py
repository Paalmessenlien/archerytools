Migration 053: Spine Calculation Method Enhancement
September 2025

This migration documents the implementation of multiple spine calculation methods,
including Universal Formula (default), German Industry Standard, and chart-based calculations.

This is a documentation-only migration as the database schema changes were
implemented directly in the spine_service.py system.

    Document the spine calculation method enhancement implementation.
    
    This migration records the addition of multiple calculation methods:
    1. Universal Formula (restored as default)
    2. German Industry Standard (specialized for recurve/traditional)
    3. Chart-based calculation (using manufacturer spine chart database)
    
    Frontend Changes:
    - ManufacturerSpineChartSelector.vue: Added calculation method dropdown
    - bowConfig.ts store: Added calculation_method and chart_selection support
    - arrow.ts types: Extended BaseBowConfiguration with new properties
    - spineCalculation.ts utils: Enhanced calculateSpineAPI with chart parameters
    
    Backend Changes:
    - spine_service.py: Added calculation_method parameter support
    - api.py: Enhanced /api/tuning/calculate-spine endpoint
    - Chart-based lookup via _lookup_chart_spine method
    
    Database Tables Used:
    - manufacturer_spine_charts_enhanced: Manufacturer chart data
    - custom_spine_charts: Admin-created custom charts
    
    API Parameters Added:
    - calculation_method: 'universal' | 'german_industry'
    - manufacturer_chart: string (manufacturer name)
    - chart_id: string (specific chart identifier)
