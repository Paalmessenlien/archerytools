## Recommended Scraping Approach

### 1. Easton Archery
- **Strategy:** Category-based crawling
- **Entry Points:** All 6 category pages (hunting, indoor, outdoor, 3D, target, recreational)
- **Expected Data Density:** High
- **Technical Specifications:** Look for spine/diameter in product details

### 2. Gold Tip & Victory
- **Strategy:** Category-based crawling  
- **Entry Points:** Hunting and target category pages
- **Expected Data Density:** Medium to High
- **Technical Specifications:** Product specification sections

### 3. Skylon
- **Strategy:** Individual product page crawling
- **Entry Points:** Specific arrow model URLs
- **Expected Data Density:** Medium
- **Technical Specifications:** Product detail pages

## Data Schema Refinements

Based on analysis, recommend these schema additions:

```json
{
  "category_classification": {
    "primary_type": ["hunting", "target", "indoor", "outdoor", "3d", "recreational"],
    "secondary_features": ["carbon", "aluminum", "precision", "speed"]
  },
  "spine_format_variations": {
    "integer_values": [300, 340, 400, 500],
    "decimal_values": [23.9, 24.6, 24.9],
    "range_values": ["300-400", "medium-heavy"]
  },
  "manufacturer_specific_fields": {
    "easton": ["shaft_family", "series_name"],
    "goldtip": ["hunting_category", "target_category"], 
    "victory": ["arrow_line", "performance_level"],
    "skylon": ["id_series", "diameter_class"]
  }
}
```

## Next Steps for Phase 1.3

1. **Implement manufacturer-specific scrapers** based on identified patterns
2. **Create extraction prompts** tailored to each manufacturer's data presentation
3. **Implement rate limiting** with 1-3 second delays between requests
4. **Add error handling** for varying page structures
5. **Test data extraction** on sample pages before full crawling

## Risk Assessment

- **Low Risk:** All manufacturers responded successfully
- **Medium Risk:** Varying data presentation formats require flexible parsing
- **Mitigation:** Implement manufacturer-specific extraction strategies
