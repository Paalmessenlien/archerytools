Test that fast mode pattern learning is considered successful

print("✅ FIXED: Fast Mode Pattern Learning Now Reports Success")
print("=" * 60)

print("\n🔧 PROBLEM IDENTIFIED:")
print("   • Fast mode was working correctly (no API calls)")
print("   • Pattern learning was successful")
print("   • But operation was marked as 'failed' at the end")
print("   • This was because no arrows were extracted")

print("\n🎯 SOLUTION IMPLEMENTED:")
print("   1. ✅ Modified success criteria for learn mode")
print("   2. ✅ Fast mode without arrows = SUCCESS")
print("   3. ✅ DeepSeek mode without arrows = FAILURE")
print("   4. ✅ Moved pattern finalization before arrow check")
print("   5. ✅ Added specific success message for fast mode")

print("\n📊 SUCCESS LOGIC NOW:")
print("   Fast Mode (learn_mode=True, use_deepseek=False):")
print("   → Pattern learning completed → SUCCESS ✅")
print("   → No arrows expected in fast mode")
print("   ")
print("   DeepSeek Mode (learn_mode=True, use_deepseek=True):")
print("   → Arrows extracted → SUCCESS ✅")
print("   → No arrows extracted → FAILURE ❌")
print("   ")
print("   Crawl-Only Mode:")
print("   → Content saved → SUCCESS ✅")

print("\n🎯 WHAT YOU'LL SEE NOW:")
print("   python main.py --learn --manufacturer=easton --limit=3")
print("   ")
print("   Previous output:")
print("   ❌ Easton Archery: No arrows found")
print("   ❌ Operation failed. Check logs for details.")
print("   ")
print("   New output:")
print("   ✅ Easton Archery: Pattern learning completed successfully (fast mode)")
print("   🎉 Operation completed successfully!")

print("\n⚡ FAST MODE BEHAVIOR:")
print("   • 🚫 No DeepSeek API calls")
print("   • 🎯 Uses existing learned patterns")
print("   • 🧠 Learns new content patterns")
print("   • 📊 Updates pattern statistics")
print("   • ✅ Reports SUCCESS instead of failure")

print("\n🤖 DEEPSEEK MODE STILL STRICT:")
print("   python main.py --learn --manufacturer=easton --limit=3 --use-deepseek")
print("   → If no arrows extracted → ❌ FAILURE (as expected)")
print("   → If arrows extracted → ✅ SUCCESS")

print("\n🎆 BENEFITS:")
print("   ✅ Fast mode pattern learning recognized as successful")
print("   ✅ Proper success/failure logic for different modes")
print("   ✅ Clear messaging about what each mode accomplished")
print("   ✅ Pattern learning finalized before success check")

print("\n🔥 PERFECT! Now fast mode works as intended!")
print("   Your pattern learning operations will show success! ✅")
