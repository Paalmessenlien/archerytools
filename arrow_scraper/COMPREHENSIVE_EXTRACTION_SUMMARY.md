  - Easton Archery: 19 URLs
  - Gold Tip: 31 URLs
  - Victory Archery: 18 URLs
  - Skylon Archery: 21 URLs
  - Nijora Archery: 57 URLs
  - DK Bow: 6 URLs
  - Pandarus Archery: 11 URLs
  - BigArchery: 37 URLs
  - Carbon Express: 9 URLs

### Proven Multi-Manufacturer Success
‚úÖ **Easton Archery** - Excellent extraction rate
‚úÖ **Gold Tip** - Successfully extracting spine-specific data
‚úÖ **Victory Archery** - Working extraction
‚úÖ **Multiple other manufacturers** - Infrastructure in place

## üéØ Core Problem SOLVED

**BEFORE**: Scrapers only saved the first GPI weight, diameter, and length values
**AFTER**: Each arrow now has complete spine-specific specifications

### Example Results Demonstrating Success:

#### 4MM Axis‚Ñ¢ Long Range Match Grade
- **Spine 250**: 9.8 GPI, 0.244" diameter, 33.0" length
- **Spine 300**: 9.3 GPI, 0.241" diameter, 32.5" length  
- **Spine 340**: 8.3 GPI, 0.234" diameter, 32.0" length
- **Spine 400**: 7.6 GPI, 0.229" diameter, 31.5" length

#### X10 Target Arrows
- **14 different spine options** with unique GPI weights and diameters
- Complete specification tables extracted

#### Gold Tip Kinetic Hunting Arrows
- **5 spine options** with manufacturer-specific data formatting
- Cross-manufacturer compatibility proven

## üèóÔ∏è Infrastructure Built
