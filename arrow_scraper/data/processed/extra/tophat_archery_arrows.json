      "description": "Many archers prefer the thin diameters for Field and Target. Now the ABSOLUTE.Series also offers a slim shaft in its lineup. The spine values cover a wide range of applications. Available in spine 350, 400, 500, and 600. The matching point is the SL Convex III made of tool steel, extremely durable. Shaft bending is nearly eliminated as a result. Break-Off elements in 10-grain increments make tuning easy—one point for weights from 90 to 140 grain. Components are available separately.",
