The design is naturally suited for bows beyond 50 lbs. These premium Carbon Express layers are wound under extremely high pressure, and the curing time in the oven is slightly longer than in standard Carbon Express shaft production. Through this newly developed construction, utilizing the latest aerospace-grade Carbon Express fibers available on the market, which are pressed together in varying windings, the Elsu Pro stabilizes very quickly when shot from the bow with high acceleration pressure and speed. As a result, it achieves an even flatter trajectory compared to a standard cylindrically wound shaft of the same weight and spine value. The Elsu Pro Carbon Express shaft is a thin full-Carbon Express shaft, crafted using multilayer technology and hand-sanded: linear inner diameter ID 0.204 inch / 5.18mm.",

With the heavier front end near the insert, you get a better Front-of-Center (FOC), which gives you more stored energy. It comes with standard CT nocks and premium CT inserts. No matter where you cut the shaft, the nocks and inserts fit correctly.

When the difference in success for FITA, NAA, and NFAA long-distance shooting can come down to mere millimeters, the Nano-Pro X-Treme delivers pinpoint precision thanks to its multi-spine construction. With this design, the Nano-Pro X-Treme recovers faster after the shot while simultaneously delivering the flattest trajectory and unmatched close-range accuracy. It stays true to the NanoPro™ series form and has the smallest diameter of all our target arrows. Combined with the parallel shaft design, side wind drift is virtually eliminated. Unlike arrows with an aluminum core, the Nano series does not take on a fixed (permanent) bend and maintains its initial spine tolerance consistently over multiple seasons.",

The Nano SST™ features Tri-Spine Technology with three specific spine ranges, where the stiffest spine is located in the middle of the shaft and the weakest spine is configured at the rear end to ensure optimal fletching clearance through the shot on a recurve bow. The Nano SST™ has an ultra-slim parallel shaft profile that drastically reduces side wind drift, making it the ideal arrow for FITA, NAA, and NFAA long-distance shooting. The Nano SST™ is engineered for optimal speed, strength, and consistency, constructed from 30-T Carbon Express, ensuring it does not take a set (permanent bend) and delivers faster recovery from the bow with superior precision in post-shot distance shooting.",

The new high-tech Carbon Express arrow shaft design features stiffer ends to limit the bending of the arrow into the so-called RED ZONE®. The RED ZONE is the section of the arrow shaft engineered to contain Dynamic Spine, enabling a more consistent shot with a broader head. The smaller diameter of the Maxima RED® SD ensures improved penetration and reduces wind drift, allowing for more precise shots at longer distances.",

The micro-diameter size is designed to shoot better and helps compensate for the off-center design of most recurve and longbows manufactured today. Black Eagle Eagle paired the Instinct® with a SUPER TOUGH stainless steel outsert weighing 100 grains, giving you the front weight you desire. Each Instinct® arrow's points are hand-painted and quality-tested, delivering custom arrow quality and an attractive traditional look at a VERY affordable price. The Duracoat wood grain on the shaft allows for refletching and re-cresting. Instinct® arrows are sorted for straightness, spine-matched, and weight-balanced to ensure the quality and durability you expect from Black Eagle Eagle Arrows. We believe traditional archers will no longer need traditional arrows. Test your Instincts® and experience the Black Eagle Eagle difference today!",

      "description": "The ORYX™ is our all-round talent. 100% Carbon Express prepregs are wound into an optimal shaft for target and 3D archery. The spine range of 350 to 1300 and precisely matched accessories allow for almost any configuration with every bow type. Olympic recurve archers will appreciate its forgiving and consistent accuracy, even at long distances. Weight-matched to established Carbon Express/aluminum WA shafts, this shaft remains robust and consistent, especially in the .003 and .001 straightness tolerances, contributing to tight groups. Spines 350 to 500 are particularly popular among compound archers. These spines are also equipped with a solid dose of kinetic energy and durability, ensuring precise flight, tight groups, and minimal arrow loss from robin-hooding, even in all weather conditions at 50m. The characteristics of the ORYX™ immediately caught the attention of traditional 3D archers, leading us to offer this shaft in a more cost-effective .006 straightness since June 2013. High accuracy in all weather conditions and extreme durability are qualities 3D archers repeatedly emphasize. A single ORYX™ shaft often gets to see trees from the inside. If you need a soft shaft for a long draw length, the ORYX™ is the alternative for you, as the shaft comes in all spines with a 33″ raw shaft length. Durability and extreme accuracy in all conditions will pleasantly surprise you.",

UHYRE™ is a combination of 100% high-modulus Carbon Express prepregs and a newly formulated resin system. This allowed us to achieve remarkable weight savings while simultaneously increasing stability and durability. The wildest FOC desires are now possible with this shaft. Recurve and compound archers won’t believe their eyes. The shaft instantly converts the bow’s impulse power into forward momentum. It also wastes no energy during flight through unnecessary oscillation. It stabilizes in the shortest time, reaching the target with minimal loss of kinetic energy. Straight flight trajectories at speeds beyond 300 fps are possible with UHYRE™ without extensive bow tuning. High-modulus Carbon Express in spines 400 to 800 will challenge your shooting skills. Once tamed, UHYRE™ will help you push new performance limits.",

The performance parameters of the shafts allow razor-sharp trajectories over longer distances with excellent penetration power in the target. With the 0.246\" inner diameter, most 5/16\" or 9/32\" components available on the market fit perfectly into the AGIL™. This allows you to rely on familiar or already existing components. After numerous durability tests, we succeeded in transferring the performance parameters to the spine 700 as well. Archers with low draw weights have experienced a very lightweight and extremely robust shaft since the introduction of the AGIL™ spine 700 in June 2012. Much flatter and faster trajectories than with spine 600 and heavy points at low draw weights—a concept that is already being copied by other competitors. The AGIL™ can be tuned equally well into an optimal arrow for Target, Field, or 3D shooting and will not only impress you.",

      "description": "Hunting accuracy for the archer was the focus in the development of the Easton Archery 6.5 arrows. The 6.5 utilizes the proprietary Acu-Carbon Express™ Uniform Spine process. Acu-Carbon Express™ is a continuous feed manufacturing process that achieves the most reliable tolerances, eliminating the need for spine alignment and weight sorting. Easton Archery's Acu-Carbon Express™ production line produces the most consistent spines and weights year after year, dozen after dozen. This benefits the bowhunter with more precise flight and higher target accuracy in the field. Easton Archery, the leading name in archery since 1922, has announced the new 6.5 hunting arrow series, now available. The Easton Archery 6.5MM™ arrows are USA-made shafts, offering bowhunters the highest level of precision available today—at prices that fit virtually any budget. The Easton Archery 6.5 features NEW 6.5MM inserts, manufactured with a 4X larger shoulder to increase strength and enhance valuable FOC. The 6.5 will also include Microlite nocks, designed to bring the nock throat closer to the back of the arrow shaft. This simplifies the release and further optimizes shot precision.

New for the 2020 indoor season, Easton Archery announces the most precise, technically advanced indoor arrow shaft ever developed for recurve archers—the brand-new RX-7 series. Available in three spine values—525, 475, and 420—in diameters 21, 22, and World Archery Maximum 23. Easton Archery's new RX-7 series 7178 aluminum arrow shafts feature a precision rear taper—allowing recurve archers to shoot a larger arrow with reduced bow weight and less point weight while maintaining maximum shaft diameter for higher scoring potential. The RX-7 proved itself during the 2018-19 competition season with some of the world's top archers, including Brady Ellison and Jack Williams of Team USA. It is based on the same proven design principle as Easton Archery's X10 and A/C/E shafts, with a precise, flexible, forgiving rear taper. Williams said: \"The RX-7's rear taper creates the most forgiving aluminum arrow for a recurve archer. It allows archers to use lighter point weights to achieve proper tuning, enabling faster releases and better arrow flight.\" This design element reduces the dynamic spine of the arrow shaft by up to a full size, allowing the use of a larger diameter and lighter point. Previously, many archers seeking maximum-diameter shafts often compromised bow tuning and potentially sacrificed shot-forgiveness by using super-heavy points, leading to greater error potential with slight release variations. By using a standard weight point and a precision-engineered, more flexible rear taper with a forward-weighted design, the RX-7 series shafts offer the ultimate shot-forgiveness. The RX-7 uses a solid 7178-T9 alloy that handles tough European target materials with ease. RX-7 shafts come with Easton Archery Super-UNI bushings, accommodating available Easton Archery Super Nocks, 3D Super Nocks, and the popular Beiter nock in size 19. The updated tuning chart for the RX-7 is available online at www.Easton Archeryarchery.com. RX-7 shafts are 100% made in the USA.

In response to requests from top archers worldwide, we have updated the all-silver look of the X23/27 series shafts with a hard-coated, Black Eagle, diamond-polished finish. The classic diamond-polished silver finish on the X23 nock end remains unmistakable on the line and in your quiver, while the deep Black Eagle polished finish on the front half ensures easier visibility for line-catchers. The world-record-worthy, U.S.-made X27 and X23 are undoubtedly the most precise arrows ever built—meeting the highest standards for world-class tournament archers. With the most demanding spine, highest weight, and straightest tolerances of any arrow, the X-series delivers the precision competitors need to gain those extra few points required to win at the highest levels of tournament competition. The X27 is the perfect teammate where regulations allow a maximum-diameter 27-class shaft, such as at The Vegas Shoot. The X23 sizes, including the new 2318, comply with World Archery rules, where 9.3 mm is the maximum permitted shaft diameter. The X-series is available in five large-outer-diameter sizes: 2312, 2314, 2315, 2318, and 2712.

      "description": "NEW Easton Archery RX7 - The Ultimate Indoor Recurve Arrow Shaft Easton Archery's exclusive Tapered Technology enables a larger line-catcher arrow with lower bow and/or point weight. New for the 2020 indoor season, Easton Archery announces the most precise, technically advanced indoor arrow shaft ever developed for recurve archers—the brand-new RX-7 series. Available in three spine values—525, 475, and 420—in diameters 21, 22, and World Archery Maximum 23. Easton Archery's new RX-7 series 7178 aluminum arrow shafts feature a precision rear taper—allowing recurve archers to shoot a larger arrow with lower bow weight and less point weight while maintaining maximum shaft diameter for higher scoring potential. The RX-7 proved itself during the 2018-19 competition season with some of the world's best archers, including Brady Ellison and Jack Williams from Team USA. It is based on the same proven design principle as Easton Archery's X10 and A/C/E shafts, with a precise, flexible, forgiving rear taper. Williams said: \"The RX-7's rear taper creates the most forgiving aluminum arrow for a recurve archer. It allows archers to use a lighter point weight to achieve proper tuning, enabling faster release and better arrow flight.\" This design element reduces the dynamic spine of the arrow shaft by up to a full size, allowing the use of a larger diameter and lighter point. Previously, many archers seeking maximum-diameter shafts often had to compromise bow tuning and potentially risk the forgiveness of shooting technique by using super-heavy points, leading to greater error potential with slight release variations. By using a standard weight point and a precision-engineered, more flexible rear taper with a forward-weighted design, the RX-7 series shafts offer the ultimate forgiveness at release. The RX-7 uses a solid 7178-T9 alloy that easily handles tough European target materials. RX-7 shafts come with Easton Archery Super-UNI bushings, accommodating available Easton Archery Super Nocks, 3D Super Nocks, and the popular Beiter nock in size 19. The updated tuning chart for the RX-7 is available online at www.Easton Archeryarchery.com. RX-7 shafts are 100% made in the USA. A technical article detailing tuning techniques for the RX7 can be read at the link below. https://Easton Archeryarchery.com/2019/10/technical-guide-to-setting-up-the-Easton Archery-rx-7-arrow-shaft/",
