## Quick Start Commands

### üöÄ Unified Startup System (Recommended)

**All deployment scenarios are handled by the unified `start-unified.sh` script:**

```bash
./start-unified.sh --help              # Show comprehensive help and documentation
```

**üîß Development Modes:**
```bash
# Local development (no Docker) - Recommended for frontend development
./start-unified.sh dev start           # Start API and frontend locally
./start-unified.sh dev stop            # Stop local development services

# Docker development - Recommended for backend development  
./start-unified.sh                     # Start full Docker development environment
```

**üöÄ Production Modes:**
```bash
# Production HTTP mode (for local testing)
./start-unified.sh production start    # Start production environment locally
./start-unified.sh production stop     # Stop production services

# Production SSL mode (for live deployment)
./start-unified.sh ssl yourdomain.com  # Deploy with SSL certificates
```

**üõë Stopping Services:**
