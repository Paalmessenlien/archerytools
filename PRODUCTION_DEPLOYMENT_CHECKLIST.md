## Deployment Steps

### Step 1: Pull Latest Changes
```bash
# On production server
cd /path/to/archerytools
git pull

# Verify commit hash
git log --oneline -1
# Should show: 9719d20 üîß Complete Database Schema Verification Fix & Startup Cleanup (August 2025)
```

### Step 2: Deploy with Unified Script (Recommended)
```bash
# Deploy to production with SSL - migrations run automatically
./start-unified.sh ssl yourdomain.com

# The script will automatically:
# - Detect new migrations (027, 028, 029)
# - Run migrations in correct dependency order
# - Start all services with proper configuration
# - Display status and access URLs
```

### Step 3: Verify Migration Success
```bash
# Check migration status via admin panel
# Navigate to: https://yourdomain.com/admin
# Go to "Maintenance" tab ‚Üí "Database Migrations"
# Should show migrations 027, 028, 029 as applied

# Alternative: Check via database directly
sqlite3 /app/databases/arrow_database.db "SELECT version, description, applied_at FROM migration_history ORDER BY version;"
```

### Step 4: Verify Schema Verification
```bash
# Access admin panel: https://yourdomain.com/admin
# Navigate to "Maintenance" tab ‚Üí "Schema Verification"
# Should show:
# - General Schema: Valid (was Invalid)
# - Unified Schema: Complete
# - No missing columns warnings (was 17 missing columns)
```

### Alternative: Manual Deployment (If Needed)
```bash
# If automatic migration fails, run manually
cd /app
python migrations/027_add_essential_missing_columns.py /app/databases/arrow_database.db
python migrations/028_add_remaining_schema_columns.py /app/databases/arrow_database.db  
python migrations/029_fix_remaining_schema_issues.py /app/databases/arrow_database.db

# Restart services
docker restart arrowtuner-api
```

## Post-Deployment Testing

### Critical Path Testing

#### 1. Admin Panel Schema Verification
**Test Case**: Verify schema verification shows no warnings

**Expected Result**: General Schema: Valid, no missing columns

**Test Steps**:
1. Navigate to `https://yourdomain.com/admin`
2. Go to "Maintenance" tab ‚Üí "Schema Verification"
3. Verify shows:
   - ‚úÖ General Schema: Valid (was Invalid)
   - ‚úÖ Unified Schema: Complete
   - ‚úÖ No missing columns warnings

#### 2. Database Migration Status
**Test Case**: Verify all migrations applied successfully

**Expected Result**: Migrations 027, 028, 029 showing as applied

**Test Steps**:
1. Navigate to admin panel "Maintenance" tab
2. Check "Database Migrations" section
3. Verify migrations show as applied:
   - ‚úÖ 027: Add Essential Missing Columns
   - ‚úÖ 028: Add Remaining Schema Columns  
   - ‚úÖ 029: Fix Remaining Schema Verification Issues

#### 3. OAuth Authentication
**Test Case**: Verify Google OAuth login works correctly

**Expected Result**: Login succeeds without "Invalid token" errors

**Test Steps**:
1. Log out if currently logged in
2. Click "Sign in with Google"
3. Complete OAuth flow
4. Verify successful login and profile access

#### 4. Database Health Check
**Test Case**: Verify database maintains health score

**Test Steps**:
```bash
# Direct health check
curl https://yourdomain.com/api/admin/database/health

# Should show health score 100/100 and no integrity issues
```

#### 5. Core Functionality Verification
**Test Case**: Verify core bow setup functionality works

**Test Steps**:
1. Navigate to bow setup configuration
2. Create/modify a bow setup
3. Add arrows to setup
4. Generate arrow recommendations
5. Verify equipment management works

### Performance Monitoring

#### Metrics to Monitor (First 24 Hours)
- **Schema Verification Status**: Should show "General Schema: Valid"
- **Migration Status**: All 3 migrations (027, 028, 029) applied successfully
- **Database Health Score**: Should maintain 100/100
- **API Response Times**: Should remain at baseline levels
- **Error Rates**: No increase in 500 errors
- **OAuth Authentication**: Login success rate should remain stable

#### Alert Conditions
- Schema verification showing "Invalid" status
- Missing columns warnings reappearing
- Migration failures or rollbacks
- Database health score dropping below 95/100
- OAuth authentication failures > 10% rate
- API response times > 10s consistently

### Success Criteria

#### ‚úÖ Deployment Successful When:
- [x] Migrations 027, 028, 029 applied without errors
- [x] Schema verification shows "General Schema: Valid"
- [x] No missing columns warnings in admin panel
- [x] Database health score maintains 100/100
- [x] OAuth authentication working correctly
- [x] All core functionality operational
- [x] No increase in error rates

#### ‚ùå Rollback Required If:
- [ ] Schema verification still shows "Invalid" after 30 minutes
- [ ] Missing columns warnings persist
- [ ] Database migrations failing to apply
- [ ] Critical functionality broken (bow setups, arrow recommendations)
- [ ] OAuth authentication failing consistently
- [ ] Database corruption or integrity issues

## Rollback Procedure

### Important Note on SQLite Limitations
SQLite doesn't support `DROP COLUMN`, so migration rollback is limited. Database restore is the primary rollback method.

### Emergency Database Restore (Primary Method)
```bash
# 1. Stop services
docker stop arrowtuner-api arrowtuner-frontend arrowtuner-nginx

# 2. Restore from backup (use admin panel backup system)
# Via admin panel: Navigate to /admin ‚Üí Backup/Restore ‚Üí Select recent backup
# Or manual restore:
./restore-databases.sh --file schema_fix_pre_deploy.tar.gz

# 3. Restart services
./start-unified.sh ssl yourdomain.com

# 4. Verify restoration
curl https://yourdomain.com/api/health
curl https://yourdomain.com/api/admin/database/schema-verify
```

### Git Revert (If Issues with Code)
```bash
# 1. Revert to previous commit
git revert 9719d20

# 2. Redeploy without schema fixes
./start-unified.sh ssl yourdomain.com

# 3. Verify revert successful
# Schema verification will show warnings again, but system should be stable
```

### Manual Column Removal (SQLite Workaround)
```bash
# If specific columns cause issues, they can be ignored in queries
# This requires code changes rather than database changes
# Contact development team for code-based rollback
```

## Additional Considerations

### Database Impact
- **+32 columns** added across multiple tables
- **100% backward compatibility** maintained
- **Zero data loss** during migration process
- **Compatibility aliases** created for legacy column references

### Migration Dependencies
- Migrations must run in sequence: 027 ‚Üí 028 ‚Üí 029
- Each migration checks for previous migration completion
- Failed migrations will prevent subsequent ones from running

### Browser Caching
- Admin panel may cache schema verification results
- Users might need to refresh browser to see updated status
- Consider hard refresh (Ctrl+F5) if issues persist

### Load Impact
- Migrations add columns but don't affect performance
- Schema verification is read-only operation
- No impact on core user functionality during deployment
