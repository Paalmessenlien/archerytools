# Complete Bareshaft Tuning Guide: How to Read and Fix Arrow Flight Problems

Bareshaft tuning reveals your bow's true arrow flight by removing the "training wheels" of fletching. This practical guide teaches you how to read bareshaft impact patterns and make the exact adjustments needed to achieve perfect arrow flight across all bow types.

## What bareshaft testing reveals

A bareshaft test compares unfletched arrows to identical fletched arrows, exposing tuning problems that fletching normally masks. When you shoot a bareshaft, you're seeing the arrow's raw flight characteristics - every wobble, every incorrect bend, every timing issue that fletching would otherwise correct.

**Why bareshafts matter**: Fletched arrows can group well even with poor tuning because the vanes constantly steer the arrow back on course. Bareshafts fly true only when everything is perfectly matched - bow timing, arrow spine, nocking point, and rest position. Once bareshafts fly straight, your broadheads will too.

## Setting up for bareshaft testing

**Equipment needed**:
- 3-6 arrows identical to your hunting/target arrows
- Remove fletching and add equivalent weight in tape at nock end
- Target with clear aiming points
- Measuring tools for adjustments
- Notebook for recording results

**Testing distances**:
- **Start close**: 12-15 yards for recurve/traditional, 15-20 yards for compound
- **Progress gradually**: Move back only after achieving good results at closer distances
- **Maximum distances**: 30 yards recurve, 40 yards compound

**Critical setup requirements**:
- Your bow must be properly sighted and shooting fletched arrows accurately first
- Maintain absolutely consistent shooting form - bareshafts amplify any inconsistencies
- Use soft targets to clearly see arrow angle on impact
- Test on calm days - wind affects bareshafts much more than fletched arrows

## How to read bareshaft impact patterns

### Step 1: Shoot your control group
First, shoot 3 fletched arrows at your aiming point. Note where they impact and how they're grouped. This is your baseline.

### Step 2: Shoot bareshafts at the same target
From the exact same position, shoot 3 bareshafts at the same aiming point. Walk to the target and compare the two groups.

### Step 3: Read the pattern
Look at two things:
1. **Where the bareshafts hit** compared to fletched arrows
2. **How the bareshafts sit in the target** (straight or angled)

## Reading vertical problems (up and down issues)

### Bareshafts hitting HIGH

**What this means**: Your nocking point is too low
**Why this happens**: The arrow is leaving the bow with the nock end too low, causing it to porpoise upward in flight

**How to fix it**:
- **All bow types**: Raise your nocking point
- **Recurve/Traditional**: Move nocking point UP the string by 1/32" increments
- **Compound**: Lower your rest by 1/32" increments (if using a nocking point, raise it)

**Test again after each adjustment** - make small changes and verify results

### Bareshafts hitting LOW

**What this means**: Your nocking point is too high
**Why this happens**: The arrow leaves with nock end too high, causing downward porpoising

**How to fix it**:
- **Recurve/Traditional**: Move nocking point DOWN the string by 1/32" increments  
- **Compound**: Raise your rest by 1/32" increments (if using nocking point, lower it)

**When vertical adjustments don't work**:
- Check cam timing (compound bows)
- Verify arrow clearance through the bow
- Examine your anchor point consistency

## Reading horizontal problems (left and right issues)

**Critical note**: The following instructions are for right-handed archers. Left-handed archers should reverse all left/right directions.

### Bareshafts hitting LEFT (Right-handed archer)

**What this means**: Your arrows are acting too STIFF for your setup
**Why this happens**: The arrow isn't bending enough around the bow during archer's paradox

**How to fix it** (try these in order):

**For Compound Bows**:
1. Move rest LEFT by 1/64" increments (chase the bareshaft)
2. If rest movement doesn't work: add point weight (25-grain increments)
3. If persistent: check cam timing and consider shimming cams left

**For Olympic Recurve**:
1. DECREASE plunger tension by 1/4 turn
2. OR increase point weight by 25-50 grains
3. OR move plunger button OUT (away from riser) by 1/32"

**For Traditional Bows**:
1. Increase point weight by 25-50 grains
2. OR raise brace height by 1/4" (add string twists)
3. OR use softer/thinner strike plate material
4. OR move silencers away from center serving

### Bareshafts hitting RIGHT (Right-handed archer)

**What this means**: Your arrows are acting too WEAK for your setup
**Why this happens**: The arrow is bending too much, taking longer to recover

**How to fix it** (try these in order):

**For Compound Bows**:
1. Move rest RIGHT by 1/64" increments
2. If rest movement doesn't work: reduce point weight (25-grain increments)
3. If persistent: arrow spine is too weak - consider stiffer arrows

**For Olympic Recurve**:
1. INCREASE plunger tension by 1/4 turn
2. OR decrease point weight by 25-50 grains
3. OR move plunger button IN (toward riser) by 1/32"
4. OR shorten arrows by 1/4" if possible

**For Traditional Bows**:
1. Decrease point weight by 25-50 grains
2. OR lower brace height by 1/4" (remove string twists)
3. OR use stiffer/thicker strike plate material
4. OR shorten arrows by 1/4" increments

## Reading arrow angle in the target

**Look at how the bareshaft sits in the target**:

### Nock angled HIGH (point low)
- Usually confirms that nocking point is too low
- Apply the "hitting high" fixes above

### Nock angled LOW (point high)
- Usually confirms that nocking point is too high  
- Apply the "hitting low" fixes above

### Nock angled LEFT or RIGHT
- At close range (under 10 yards): confirms spine reading
- Nock right = stiff arrow, nock left = weak arrow
- At longer distances, angle may reverse - trust the impact point, not the angle

## Special considerations by bow type

### Compound bow specifics

**Cam timing issues**:
- If major rest adjustments (over 1/8") don't fix horizontal problems
- Both cams must reach full draw simultaneously
- Requires professional adjustment or shimming

**D-loop and nock pinch**:
- Add nocking points inside D-loop if bareshafts hit inconsistently high/low
- Prevents D-loop from pinching nock at full draw

### Olympic recurve specifics

**Plunger button is your primary tool**:
- Start with medium spring tension
- Make 1/4 turn adjustments and test
- Don't use plunger to "force" bareshafts into group - fix the underlying spine issue

**Clicker position affects tune**:
- Moving clicker closer effectively stiffens arrows
- Small changes (1-2mm) can significantly affect bareshaft behavior

### Barebow string walking

**Choose your tuning distance**:
- **Field archery**: Tune at median crawl (halfway between shortest/longest distances)
- **Outdoor target**: Tune at 50m crawl position
- **Indoor target**: Tune at 18m crawl position

**Accept compromise**:
- Perfect tune impossible across all crawl distances
- Aim for minimal deviation across your shooting range

### Traditional bow specifics

**Start with proper spine selection**:
- Use manufacturer spine charts as starting point
- Wood arrows vary significantly - test each shaft individually
- Carbon arrows offer more consistency

**Brace height is critical**:
- Start with manufacturer recommendations
- Adjust by adding/removing string twists
- 1/4" changes create noticeable spine effects

## Troubleshooting when adjustments don't work

### If bareshafts won't group despite adjustments

**Check these factors**:
1. **Arrow clearance**: Powder test to verify no contact with bow
2. **Consistent form**: Video your shooting to identify form issues
3. **Arrow spine matching**: You may need different spine arrows
4. **Equipment condition**: Worn rest, damaged arrows, string issues

### If you get conflicting results at different distances

**This indicates**:
- False tune (clearance problems)
- Form inconsistencies
- Environmental factors (wind)
- Equipment wear or damage

**Solutions**:
- Test in controlled conditions
- Have experienced archer shoot your setup
- Professional bow inspection

### When to stop and seek help

**Stop adjusting if**:
- Three adjustment sessions show no improvement
- Results become inconsistent or worse
- You've reached equipment limits (maximum rest travel, etc.)
- Bareshafts fly erratically despite proper spine

## Progressive testing protocol

### Phase 1: Close range (10-15 yards)
1. Establish vertical tune first (nocking point)
2. Address horizontal tune (spine/rest position)
3. Achieve consistent bareshaft grouping with fletched arrows

### Phase 2: Medium range (20-25 yards)
1. Verify tune holds at increased distance
2. Make fine adjustments (half normal increments)
3. Document any changes needed

### Phase 3: Maximum range (30-40 yards)
1. Final verification of tune
2. Minimal adjustments only
3. Accept small variations - focus on consistency

## Success indicators

**You've achieved good bareshaft tune when**:
- Bareshafts group within your fletched arrow group size
- Bareshafts enter target reasonably straight (minimal angle)
- Tune remains consistent across your shooting distances
- Broadheads (if hunting) group with field points

**Remember**: Perfect bareshaft tune isn't always possible or necessary. The goal is optimal arrow flight for your intended use - hunting accuracy, target precision, or traditional enjoyment. A bareshaft that groups within 2-3 inches of your fletched arrows and flies reasonably straight indicates excellent tune for most applications.

The bareshaft test reveals the truth about your bow-arrow combination. Master reading these patterns, and you'll unlock your equipment's full potential for accuracy and consistency.
