# Archery Calculations Guide

This document provides detailed information about the professional archery calculations implemented in the Archery Tools platform, including speed estimation, FOC (Front of Center) calculations, and optimization algorithms.

## Overview

The Archery Tools platform implements industry-standard archery physics calculations to provide accurate performance predictions, tuning recommendations, and ballistics modeling. All calculations follow established archery industry standards and are designed for professional use.

## Speed Estimation

### Industry-Accurate Speed Formula

The platform uses a sophisticated speed estimation formula based on IBO (International Bowhunting Organization) standards:

```javascript
const estimateSpeed = (totalWeight: number, drawWeight: number): number => {
  // Industry-standard IBO speed baseline (350 IBO)
  const iboBaseSpeed = 350
  const iboArrowWeight = 350  // IBO standard arrow weight
  const iboDrawWeight = 70    // IBO standard draw weight
  
  // Weight adjustment: ~0.55 fps loss per grain of additional arrow weight
  const weightDifference = totalWeight - iboArrowWeight
  const speedLossPerGrain = 0.55
  const weightAdjustment = -weightDifference * speedLossPerGrain
  
  // Draw weight adjustment: ~2.5 fps per pound of draw weight difference
  const drawWeightDifference = drawWeight - iboDrawWeight
  const speedPerPound = 2.5
  const drawWeightAdjustment = drawWeightDifference * speedPerPound
  
  return iboBaseSpeed + weightAdjustment + drawWeightAdjustment
}
```

### Key Features:
- **IBO Standard Compliance**: Uses 350 IBO baseline for modern compound bows
- **Accurate Weight Loss**: 0.55 fps per grain (industry standard ~2.75 fps per 5 grains)
- **Proper Draw Weight Scaling**: 2.5 fps per pound difference
- **Realistic Speed Constraints**: 150-400 fps range with intelligent minimums

### Previous vs Current:
- **Before**: Linear scaling with 320 IBO baseline and incorrect weight factors
- **After**: Industry-accurate formula matching real-world performance data

## FOC (Front of Center) Calculation

### Physics-Based FOC Formula

The platform implements a comprehensive FOC calculation using actual component weight distribution:

```javascript
const calculateAdvancedFOC = () => {
  // Component positions (inches from nock end)
  const positions = {
    nock: 0,
    fletching: 3,
    shaft: arrowLength / 2,      // Center of mass for uniform shaft
    bushing: arrowLength,
    insert: arrowLength,
    point: arrowLength + 0.5     // Point extends beyond shaft
  }
  
  // Calculate balance point using moment arm principle
  const weightedMoments = 
    (nockWeight * positions.nock) +
    (fletchingWeight * positions.fletching) +
    (shaftWeight * positions.shaft) +
    (bushingWeight * positions.bushing) +
    (insertWeight * positions.insert) +
    (pointWeight * positions.point)
  
  const balancePoint = weightedMoments / totalWeight
  const physicalCenter = arrowLength / 2
  
  // Industry standard FOC formula
  return ((balancePoint - physicalCenter) / arrowLength) * 100
}
```

### Key Features:
- **Component Positioning**: Accounts for exact positions of all arrow components
- **Moment Arm Physics**: Uses proper physics for balance point calculation
- **Industry Standard Formula**: FOC% = ((Balance Point - Physical Center) / Arrow Length) × 100
- **Professional Accuracy**: Results match physical balance measurements

### Previous vs Current:
- **Before**: Flawed calculation assuming balance point = center (always 0) + arbitrary multiplier
- **After**: Physics-based calculation using actual component weight distribution

## Reset to Recommended Optimization

### Intelligent Optimization Algorithm

The "Reset to Recommended" function now implements a comprehensive optimization algorithm that actually improves compatibility scores:

```javascript
const resetToRecommended = async () => {
  // Generate test configurations
  const testConfigurations = []
  
  // Test multiple combinations of:
  // - Arrow lengths: ±0.5" around recommended
  // - Point weights: 85, 100, 115, 125, 140 grains
  // - All available spine options
  
  // Test each configuration and find the best compatibility score
  let bestScore = currentScore
  let bestConfig = null
  
  for (const testConfig of testConfigurations) {
    const response = await api.post('/calculate-compatibility-score', {
      arrow_id: props.arrow.id,
      bow_config: bowConfig,
      arrow_config: testConfig
    })
    
    if (response.compatibility_score > bestScore) {
      bestScore = response.compatibility_score
      bestConfig = testConfig
    }
  }
  
  // Apply the configuration that produces the highest compatibility score
  if (bestConfig) {
    applyOptimalConfiguration(bestConfig)
  }
}
```

### Key Features:
- **Actual Optimization**: Tests multiple configurations to find the best compatibility score
- **Comprehensive Testing**: Evaluates length, weight, and spine combinations
- **Performance-Conscious**: Uses batched API calls with delays
- **Intelligent Fallback**: Provides reasonable defaults if optimization fails

### Previous vs Current:
- **Before**: Applied fixed values (100gr point weight) without testing compatibility
- **After**: Iterative testing that actually improves compatibility scores

## API Performance Improvements

### Enhanced Error Handling

Fixed false positive API warnings that were confusing users:

```javascript
const calculatePerformanceAPI = async () => {
  try {
    const result = await calculateTrajectory(arrowData, bowConfig)
    
    // Check for actual trajectory data, not just truthy response
    if (!result || !hasTrajectoryData.value) {
      console.warn('API calculation failed, using fallback - no valid trajectory data')
    }
  } catch (error) {
    console.warn('API calculation failed, using fallback - exception:', error)
  }
}
```

### Key Features:
- **Proper Validation**: Checks for actual trajectory data instead of just truthy responses
- **Clear Messaging**: Distinguishes between API failures and successful calculations

```javascript
// For a 30" arrow with 125gr point:
const foc = calculateAdvancedFOC()
// Result: ~13.2% FOC (excellent for hunting)
```

def _get_speed_adjustment(self, ibo_speed: float) -> float:
    """Calculate spine adjustment based on bow speed."""
    baseline_ibo = 330.0
    speed_difference = ibo_speed - baseline_ibo
    
    # Progressive adjustment factors for different speed ranges
    if speed_difference <= 15:  # Average range (315-345 FPS)
        return speed_difference * 0.2  # 0.2 lbs per FPS
    elif speed_difference <= 30:  # Fast bows (345-360 FPS)
        return 3.0 + (speed_difference - 15) * 0.4
    elif speed_difference <= 45:  # Very fast bows (360-375 FPS)
        return 9.0 + (speed_difference - 30) * 0.6
    else:  # Extreme speed bows (375+ FPS)
        return 18.0 + (speed_difference - 45) * 0.8
```

### Dynamic Spine Modeling

Enhanced spine calculations now account for real-world launch dynamics:

```python
def calculate_dynamic_spine(self, static_spine: float, arrow_weight: float, 
                          point_weight: float, bow_speed: float) -> float:
    """Calculate dynamic spine considering launch physics."""
    
    # Base dynamic spine factor from static spine
    dynamic_factor = 1.0 + (400.0 - static_spine) / 2000.0
    
    # Arrow weight influence (heavier arrows act stiffer)
    weight_factor = 1.0 + (arrow_weight - 350.0) / 1750.0
    
    # Point weight influence (heavier points act weaker)
    point_factor = 1.0 - (point_weight - 100.0) / 2500.0
    
    # Speed influence (faster bows need stiffer arrows)
    speed_factor = 1.0 + (bow_speed - 300.0) / 1500.0
    
    return static_spine * dynamic_factor * weight_factor * point_factor * speed_factor
```

### Key Features:

```python
@dataclass
class ArrowParadoxParameters:
    static_spine: float = 340.0
    dynamic_spine_factor: float = 1.0
    shaft_material: str = "carbon"
    bow_acceleration_time_ms: float = 8.0
    peak_acceleration_g: float = 200.0
    paradox_frequency_hz: float = 15.0
    dampening_factor: float = 0.85

def _apply_arrow_paradox_effects(self, speed_fps, weight_grains, paradox_params, shooting_params):
    """Apply arrow paradox effects to initial launch conditions."""
    
    # Calculate initial displacement from arrow paradox
    spine_stiffness = 29.0 / paradox_params.static_spine  # EI calculation
    initial_displacement = self._calculate_initial_displacement(
        spine_stiffness, weight_grains, shooting_params.release_angle_degrees
    )
    
    # Model oscillation dampening over time
    dampening_time_constant = 1.0 / (2 * math.pi * paradox_params.paradox_frequency_hz)
    
    return LaunchConditions(
        velocity_fps=speed_fps,
        launch_angle_deg=shooting_params.launch_angle_degrees + angle_correction,
        initial_displacement_inches=initial_displacement,
        oscillation_frequency_hz=paradox_params.paradox_frequency_hz,
        dampening_factor=paradox_params.dampening_factor
    )
```

### Environmental Factors

Comprehensive environmental modeling for accurate trajectory predictions:

```python
@dataclass
class EnvironmentalConditions:
    temperature_fahrenheit: float = 70.0
    altitude_feet: float = 0.0
    barometric_pressure_inhg: float = 29.92
    humidity_percent: float = 50.0
    wind_speed_mph: float = 0.0
    wind_angle_degrees: float = 0.0

def calculate_air_density_factor(self, environmental: EnvironmentalConditions) -> float:
    """Calculate air density factor for drag calculations."""
    
    # Standard air density at sea level, 59°F, 29.92 inHg
    standard_density = 0.0765  # lb/ft³
    
    # Temperature effect (ideal gas law)
    temp_ratio = 518.67 / (environmental.temperature_fahrenheit + 459.67)
    
    # Pressure effect
    pressure_ratio = environmental.barometric_pressure_inhg / 29.92
    
    # Humidity effect (water vapor is less dense than dry air)
    humidity_factor = 1.0 - (environmental.humidity_percent / 100.0) * 0.378 * (
        self._calculate_vapor_pressure(environmental.temperature_fahrenheit) / 
        environmental.barometric_pressure_inhg
    )
    
    return temp_ratio * pressure_ratio * humidity_factor
```

### Key Features:
