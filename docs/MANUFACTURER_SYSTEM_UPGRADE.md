# Manufacturer System Upgrade Progress

## Overview
Upgrading the manufacturer management system to include pending approval workflow for all manufacturer entries across equipment and bow setups. This ensures consistent manufacturer management and enables admin approval for new manufacturers.

### Key Goals:
1. Import existing manufacturers from bow setups into the manufacturer database
2. Fix pending manufacturer creation and admin approval workflow
3. Replace hardcoded manufacturer dropdowns with dynamic API-driven components
4. Implement manufacturer learning for bow setup forms
5. Create unified manufacturer input component with autocomplete

      "result": {
        "new_manufacturer": true,
        "new_model": true,
        "manufacturer_status": "pending_new",
        "model_usage_count": 1
      }
    }
  ]
}
```

### Testing Results:
